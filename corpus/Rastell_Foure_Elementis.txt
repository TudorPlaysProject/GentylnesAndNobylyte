Th[e] aboundant grace of the power deuyne 
which doth illumyne ye world inuyron 
Preserue this audyence and cause them to inclyne 
To charyte this is my petycyon 
For by your pacyens and supportacyon 
A lytyll interlude late made and preparyd 
Before your presence here shall be declaryd 
which of a few conclusyons is contriuyd 
And poyntys of phylosophy naturall 
But though the matter be not so well declaryd 
As a great clerke coude do nor so substancyall 
yet the auctour hereof requiryth you all 
Though he be yngnorant and can lytyll skyll 
To regarde his only intent and good wyll 
which in his mynde hath oft tymes ponderyd 
what nombre of bokys in our tonge maternall 
Of toyes and tryfellys be made and impryntyd 
And few of them of matter substancyall 
For though many make bokys yet vnneth ye shall 
In our englyshe tonge fynde any warkys 
Of connynge that is regardyd by clerkys 
The grekys the romayns with many other mo 
In their moder tonge wrot warkys excellent 
Than yf clerkys in this realme wolde take payn so 
Consyderyng that our tonge is now suffycyent 
To expoun any hard sentence euydent 
They myght yf they wolde in our englyshe tonge 
Wryte workys of grauyte somtyme amonge 
For dyuers pregnaunt wyttys be in this lande 
As well of noble men as of meane estate 
Which nothynge but englyshe can vnderstande
Than yf connynge laten bokys were translate 
Into englyshe wel correct and approbate 
   in englyshe myght be lernyd 
   other people in their owne tongys dyd 
   But now so it is that in our englyshe tonge 
   one there is that can but rede & wryte 
   wyll oft presume amonge
   to compyle and balatys to indyte 
Some of loue or other matter not worth a myte 
Some to opteyn fauour wyll flatter and glose 
Some wryte curyous termys nothyng to purpose 
Thus euery man after his fantesye 
wyll wryte his conseyte be it neuer so rude 
Be it vertuous vycyous wysedome or foly 
wherfore to my purpose thus I conclude 
why shold not than the auctour of this interlude 
Utter his owne fantesy and conseyte also 
As well as dyuers other now a dayes do 
For wysedome and foly is as it is takyn 
For ye one callyth wysedome a nother callyth foly 
yet amonge moste folke that man is holdyn 
moste wyse which to be ryche studyeth only 
But he that for a commyn welth bysyly 
Studyeth and laboryth and lyuyth by goddys law 
Except he wax ryche men count hym but a daw 
So he that is ryche is euer honouryd 
All though he haue got it neuer so falsely 
The pore beynge neuer so wyse is reprouyd 
This is the oppynyon moste commynly 
Thorowe out the worlde and yet no reason why 
Therfore in my mynd whan that all suche dawis 
Haue babelyd what they can no force of .ii. strawis 
For euery man in reason thus ought to do 
To labour for his owne necessary lyuynge 
And than for the welth of his neyghbour also 
But what dyuylish mynd haue they which musing 
And labouryng all their lyffys do no nother thyng 
But bringe ryches to their owne possessyon 
Nothyng regardinge their neyghbours distruccion 
yet all the ryches in the worlde that is 
Rysyth of the grounde by goddys sendynge 
And by the labour of pore mennys handys 
And though thou ryche man haue therof ye kepynge 
yet is not this ryches of thy gettynge 
Nor oughtyst not in reason to be preysyd ye more 
For by other mennys labour it is got before 
A great wytted man may sone be enrychyd 
That laboryth and studyeth for ryches only 
But how shall his conscyens than be discharged 
For all clerkys afferme that that man presysely 
which studyeth for his owne welth pryncypally 
Of god shall deserue but lytyll rewarde 
Except he the commyn welth somwhat regarde 
So they sey that that man occupyed is 
For a commyn welth which is euer laborynge 
To releue pore people with temporall goodys 
And that it is a commyn good act to brynge 
People from vyce and to vse good lyuynge 
Lyke wyse for a commyn welth occupyed is he 
That bryngyth them to knowlege ye yngnorant be 
But man to knowe god is a dyffyculte 
Except by a meane he hym selfe inure 
which is to knowe goddys creaturys that be 
As furst them that be of the grosyst nature 
And than to know them that be more pure 
And so by lytyll and lytyll ascendynge 
To know goddys creaturys & meruelous werkinge 
And this wyse man at the last shall come to 
The knowlege of god and his hye mageste 
And so to lerne to do his dewte and also 
To deserve of his goodnes partener to be 
wherfore in this work declaryd shall ye see 
Furst of the element is the sytuacyon 
And of their effectis the caule and generacyon 
And though some men thynke this matter to hye
And not mete for an audyence vnlernyd 
Me thynke for man nothynge more necessary 
Than this to know though it be not vsyd 
Nor a matter more lowe can not be arguyd 
For though the elementis goddys creaturis be 
yet they be most grose and lowyst in degre 
How dare men presume to be callyd clerkys 
Dysputynge of hye creaturis celestyall 
As thyngys inuysyble and goddys hye warkys 
And know not these vysyble thyngys inferyall 
So they wolde know hye thyngys & know nothinge at all 
Of the yerth here wheron they dayly be 
Nother the nature forme nor quantyte 
wherfore it semyth nothynge conuenyent 
A man to study and his tyme to be stowe
