God and saynt Leonarde sende ye all his grace
As many as ben assembled in this place
deuoute people that here do assemble
I pray good that ye may all well resemble
The ymage after whiche you are wrought
And that ye saue that Chryst in you bought
Deuoute Chrysten people ye shall all wytte
That I am comen hyther ye to vysytte
Wherfore let vs pray thus or I begynne
Our sauyoure preserue ye all from synne
And enable ye to receyue this blessed pardon
Whiche is the greatest vnder the son
Graunted by the pope in his bulles vnder lede
Whiche pardon ye shall fynde whan ye are dede
That offereth outher grotes or els pens
To these holy relyques whiche or I go hens
I shall here shewe in open audyence
Exortynge ye all to do to them reuerence
But fyrst ye shall knowe well yt I com fro Rome
Lo here my bulles all and some
Our lyege lorde seale here on my patent
I bere with me my body to warant
That no man be so bolde be he preest or clarke
Me to dysturbe of Chrystes holy warke
Nor haue no dysdayne nor yet scorne
Of these holy relyques whiche sayntes haue worne
Fyrst here I shewe ye of a holy Iewes shepe
A bone I pray you take good kepe
To my wordes and marke them well
Yf any of your bestes belyes do swell
Dyppe this bone in the water that he dothe take
Into his body and the swellynge shall slake
And yf any worme haue your beestes stonge
Take of this water and wasshe his tonge
And it wyll be hole anon and furthermore
Of pockes and scabbes and euery sore
He shall be quyte hole that drynketh of the well
That this bone is dipped in it is treuth that I tell
And yf any man that any beste oweth
Ones in the weke or that the cocke croweth
Fastynge wyll drynke of this well a draughte
As that holy Iew hath vs taught
His beestes and his store shall multeply
And maysters all it helpeth well
Thoughe a man be foule in ielous rage
Let a man with this water make his potage
And neuermore shall he his wyfe mystryst
Thoughe he in sothe the faut by her wyst
Or had she be take with freres two or thre
Here is a mytten eke as ye may se
He that his hande wyll put in this myttayn
He shall haue encrease of his grayn
That he hathe sowne be it wete or otys
So that he offer pens or els grotes
And another holy relyke eke here se ye may
The blessed arme of swete saynt sondaye
And who so euer is blessyd with this ryght hande
Can not spede amysse by se nor by lande
And yf he offereth eke with good deuocyon
He shall not fayle to come to hyghe promocyon
And another holy relyke here may ye see
The great too of the holy trynyte
And who so euer ones dothe it in his mouthe take
Be shall neuer be dysseasyd with the tothe ake
Canker nor pockys shall there none brede
This that I shewe ye is matter in dede
And here is of our lady a relyke full good
Her bongrace which she ware with her french hode
Whan she wente oute alwayes for sonne bornynge
Women with chylde which be in mournynge
By vertue therof shalbe sone easyd
And of theyr trauayll full sone also releasyd
And yf this bongrace they do deuoutly kys
And offer therto as theyr deuocyon is
Here is another relyke eke a precyous one
Of all helowes the blessyd Iaw bone
Which relyke without any fayle
Agaynst poyson chefely dothe preuayle
For whom so euer it toucheth without dout
All maner venym from hym shall issue out
So that it shall hurt no maner wyghte
Lo of this relyke the great power and myghte
Which preseruyth from poyson euery man
Lo of saynt Myghell eke the brayn pan
Which for the hed ake is a preseruatyfe
To euery man or beste that beryth lyfe
And further it shall stande hym in better stede
For his hede shall neuer ake whan that he is dede
Nor he shall fele no maner grefe nor payn
Though with a sworde one cleue it than a twayn
But be as one that lay in a dede slepe
Wherfore to these relykes now com crouche and crepe
But loke that ye offerynge to them make
Or els can ye no maner profyte take
But one thynge ye women all I warant you
Yf any wyght be in this place now
That hathe done syn so horryble that she
Dare nat for shame therof shryuen be
Or any woman be she yonge or olde
That hathe made her husbande cockolde
Suche folke shall haue no power nor no grace
To offer to my relykes in this place
And who so fyndyth her selfe out of suche blame
Com hyther to me on crystes holy name
