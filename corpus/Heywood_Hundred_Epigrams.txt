RYme without reason, and reason without ryme
In this conuercion depe diffrence dooeth fall.
In first parte wherof where I am falne this tyme,
The foly I graunt, which graunted (readers all)
Your graunt, to graunt this request require I shall,
Ere ye full reiecte these trifles folowyng here
Perceiue (I praie you) of the woordes th[e] ententes clere.

In which (maie ye lyke to looke) ye shall espie
Some woordes, shewe one sense, another to disclose,
Some woordes themselues sondrie senses signifie:
Some woordes, somwhat from common sence, I dispose,
To seeme one sense in text, another in glose.
These words in this work, thus wrought your workyng toole,
Maie woorke me to seeme (at least) the les a foole.

Than in rough rude termes of homely honestee,
(For vnhonest terme (I truste) there none here soundes)
Wherin fine tender eares shall offended bee,
Those folies, beyng sercht in reasons boundes,
Reason maie bee surgin in saluyng those woundes,
Turnyng those sores to salues: for reason dooeth gesse,
Homly matters, homly termes dooe best expresse.

But where all defence standth in exempcion
To defend me her in out of folies bandes,
So that to redeeme me thers no redempcion.
Grauntyng and submittyng foly, that so standes,
This last refuge I craue to haue, at your handes,
Those folies standyng clere from intent of yll.
In lieu or lacke of good wit, accept good wyll
