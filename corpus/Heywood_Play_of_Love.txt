LO syr, who so that loketh here for curtesy
And seth me seme as one pretendyng none
But as vnthought vppon thus sodenly
Approcheth the myddys amonge you euery chone
And of you all seyth nought to any one.
May thynke me rewde perceyuyng of what sorte
ye seme to be, and of what stately porte.
But I beseche you in moste humble wyse
To omytte dyspleasure and pardon me
My maner is to muse and to deuyse
So that some tyme my selfe may cary me
My selfe knowyth not where, and I asure ye
So hath my selfe done nowe, for our lorde wot
where I am, or what ye be, I knowe not.
Or whence I cam, or whyther I shall
All this in maner as vnknowen to me
But euyn as fortune guydeth my fote to fale
So wander I, yet where so euer I be
And whom or howe many so euer I se
As one person to me is euerychone
So euery place to me but as one
And for that one person euery place seke I
which one ones founde I fynde of all the rest
Not one myssyng, and in the contrary
That one absent, though that there were here prest
All the creatures lyuyng moste and lest
yet lackyng her I shulde and euer shall
Be as alone syns she to me is all
And alone is she without comparyson
Consernyng the gyftys gyuyn by nature
In fauour fayrnes and porte as of person
No lyfe beryth the lyke of that creature
Nor no tonge can attayne to put in vre
Her to dyscryue, for howe can wordes expres
That thyng the full wherof no thought can ges.
And as it is thyng inestymable
To make reporte of her bewtyfully
So is my loue to warde her vnable
To be reportyd as who seyth ryghtly
For my soole seruyce and loue to that lady
Is gyuen vnder such haboundant fashyon
That no tonge therof can make ryght relashyon.
wherin I suppose this well supposed
Unto you all, that syns she perceyuyng
As much of my loue as can be dysclosed
Euyn of very ryght in recompensyng
She ought for my loue agayne to be louyng
For what more ryght to graunt when loue loue requireth
Then loue for loue, when loue nought els desyreth
But euyn as farre wurs as otherwyse then so
Stande I in case in maner desperate
No tyme can tyme my sewt to ease my wo
Before none to erely and all tymes els to late
Thus tyme out of tyme mystymeth my rate
For tyme to bryng tyme to hope of any grace
That tyme tymyth no tyme in any tyme or place.
wherby tyll tyme haue tyme so farre extyncte
That deth may determyne my lyfe thus dedly
No tyme can I reste alas I am so lyncte
To greues both so greate and also many
That by the same I say and wyll veryfy
Of all paynes the moste incomparable payne
Is to be a louer not louyd agayne.
Syr as touchyng those wordes of comparyson
whiche ye haue seyd and wolde seme to veryfye
If it may please you to stande therupon
Hearyng and answeryng me pacyently
I doubt not by the same incontynently
your selfe to see by wordes that shall ensue
The contrary of your wordes veryfyed for true.
Fayre lady pleasyth it you to repayrenere
And in this cause to shewe cause reasonable
wherby cause of reformacyon may appere
Of reason I muste and wylbe reformable
well syns ye pretende to be confyrmable
To reason, in auoydyng circumstaunce
Brefely by reason I shall the truthe auaunce.
ye be a louer no whyt louyd agayne
And I am louyd of whom I loue nothyng
Then standyth our question betwene these twayne
Of louyng not louyd, or louyd not louyng
which is the case moste paynfull in sufferyng
wherto I saye that the moste payne doth moue
To those belouyd of whome they can not loue
Those wordes approued lo, myght make a chaunge
Of myne opinion but verely
The case as ye put it I thynke more straunge
Then true, for though the belouyd party
Can not loue agayne, yet possybly
Can I not thynke, nor I thynke neuer shall
That to be louyd can be any payne at all.
That reason perceyuyd and receyuyd for trouth
From proper comparyson sholde clere confounde me
Betwene payne and no payne, no such comparyson growth
Then or I can on comparyson grounde me
To proue my case paynefull ye haue fyrst bounde me
To whiche syns ye dryue me by your denyall
Marke what ensueth before ferther tryall.
I saye I am louyd of a certayne man
whom for no sewt I can fauour agayne
And that haue I tolde hym syns his sewt began
A thousand tymes but euery tyme in vayne
For neuer seaseth his tonge to complayne
And euer one tale whiche I neuer can flee
For euer in maner where I am is he.
Nowe if you to here one thyng euery where
Contrary to your appetyte sholde be led
were it but a mouse lo sholde pepe in your ere
Or alway to harpe on a crust of bred
Howe coulde you lyke such harpyng at your hed
