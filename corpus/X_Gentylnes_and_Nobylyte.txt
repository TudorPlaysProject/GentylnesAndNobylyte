I say the comyn well of euery land
In fete of marchauntdyse doth pryncypally stand
For if oure commoditees be vtteryd for nought
In to strange landis and no ryches brought
Hydyr therfore we shuld come to beggary
And all men dryffyn to lyf in mysery
Then we noble marchauntis that in this reame be
what a grete welth to thys land do we
we vtter our warys and by theyrs good chepe
And bryng them hyder that grete proffet
And pleasure dayly commyth to this regyon
Too all maner people that here do won
Forthermore ye see well with youre eyes
That of straynge landis the commodytees
we haue such nede of them that be there
That in no wyse we may them for bere
As oyle sylkis frutis and spyces also
Golde syluer yryn and other metall is moo
All drammys and druggys longyng to physyke
whych men must nedes haue when they be seke
whych in thys reame can not well grow
Our contrey is to colde and not hote I now
With out whych thyngis we shulde lyfe in mysery
And oft tymes for lak of them we shulde dye
And I spende my studi and labour contynually
And cause such thyngis to come hyder dayly
For the comfort of thys land and commen welth
And to all the people grete proffer and helth
And for such noble dedys reason wyll than
That I ought to be callyd a noble man
And nother of you both that here now be
In noblenes may accompare with me
Now well hit by goddes body well hit
Of one that hath but lyttyll wyt
Answere me one worde furst I pray the
what is the noblest thynge that can be
what saist thou therto thi self let see
Is not yet the noblyst thyng in dede
That of all other thyngis hath lest nede
As god which beynith etern in blysse
Is not he the noblest thyng yet is
yes mary no man in reason can that deny
well than there is no reason therof why
But because he is the thyng omnipotent
And is in him self so suffycyent
And nedyth the helpe of no nothyr thyng
To the helpe of hys gloryous beyng
But euery other thyng hath nede of his ayde
Mary that is very trough & well sayde
And lykwyse yet thynge that hath most nede
Is the thyng that is most wreched
So suffycyency is euer noblenes
And necessyte is euer wrechydnes
And he that hath more nede of that thyng
For the preseruacyon of hys lyuyng
Then his felow hath his felow must nedis be
By thys same reason more noble than he
what than P by the same reason it prouith lo
ye be but caytyffis and wrechis both two
And by the same reason proue I shall
That I am the noblyst man of vs all
For I haue nede of no maner thyng
That ye can do to help of my lyffyng
For euery thyng whereby ye do lyf
I noryss it and to you both do gyf
I plow I tyll and I ster the ground
wherby I make the corn to habounde
whereof ther is made both drynk and bred
wych the which dayly ye must nedis be fed
I noryss the catell and fowlys also
Fyssh and herbis and other thyngie mo
Fell herr and woll whych the bestis do bere
I noryssh and preserue which ye do were
which yf ye had not no dowt ye shuld
Starue for sak of clothis because of colde
So both you shulde die or lyue in necessite
If ye had not comfort and help of me
And as for your fyne cloth and costly aray
I cannot see whi ye ought or mai
Call your self noble because ye were it
which was made bi other menis labour and wit
And also your dilicate drinkis and viand
Bi other menis labours be made so pleasand
Therefore mayster marchaunt now to you I sei
I can not see but I am able and mai
Lyf wythout you or your purueaunce
Lyue wythout you or your purueyaunce
For of fode and cloth I haue suffisaunce
Of my self for lyffing necessary
And now sir knyght to you I sey playnly
I see not that ye can any thyng do
For the commyn well or ought longyng therto
But ech man beyng in auctoryte
Hauyng wit may do it as well as ye
Therfore to spek now of necessyte
Ther is nother of you both but ye be
In more nede than I therfore I sey playn
I am more noble than other of you twayn
Now that is a folysh reason so god me saue
For by the same reason thou woldyst haue
Eueri best fyssh and other foule than
To be more noble of birth than a man
For man hath more nede of bodely coueryng
Than they haue for they nede no thinge
The bestis haue herr and also a thik skin
The fissh skalis or shelis to kepe theyr bodyes in
The foulis fethirs and so eueri thing
Bi nature hath his proper couering
Saue man himself which is born all nakyd
And therfore he shuld be than most wrechyd
Mary no man can make a better reason
For that is a sure and a trew conclusyon
For if a child when he is furst born
were not holp and coueryd he were sone lorn
He hath no strenght to help hym neuer a dell
yet bestis haue power to help them self well
So consideryng manns body in dede
A best is more noble and man more wrechyd
Be cause he hath nede of many mo thyngis
Than bestis haue to help of theyer lyffyngis
Also man must dayly labour and swete
To get hym sustynaunce as drynk and mete
The grownd he must dyg and the bestis kyll
For brede and mete his bodi to fyll
Grapis frutis and herbis norssh dyligently
To make good drynkis to refressh his body
But all brut bestis haue coueryng natural
Sufficyent to couer their bodyes with all
And fynd theyr fode euer on the grownd redy
with out any payn labour or study
So eueri man by reason of hys body
Is more wrechyd and in more mysery
Than bestis be yet thus not wythstandyng
Man is most noble of creaturis lyuyng
Not by hys body for that is impotent
But by hys soule beyng so excellent
For by reason of hys soule intyllectyue
He subde wyth all other bestis alyue
And compellyth all other bestis that be
By hys wit to releue his necessyte
But bestis haue no wyt them self to defende
Nor can get no more than god hath them send
For take any best that weryth heer
And do clyp it of bare a gayns wynter
That best hath no maner of polecy
To get other coueryng for hys body
Of cloth nor skyns nor hath no wyt
To put it vppon hym though one haue made it
Nor can byld no house nor kyndyl no fyre
To warme hys body yf nede shuld requyre
But yet a man hath wyt and vnderstandyng
For to help hym self in euery such thyng
So man for his soule intellectuall
Is most noble creature of bestis all
That is a verey good and preguant reason
yet me thynkith thou makist a degression
From the argument that we furst began
which was to proue who was most gentylman
whych we disputyd I wold thou haddist hard it
Tussh I hard what ye seyd everi whit
Then shew thy reason therin or thou go
Nay be god I haue some what ells to do
I must go by me a halporth of gresse
The spokes of my cart therwith to dresse
Trow ye that I wyll leue my bysynes
For your babelyng pomp and folysshnes
Nay by sent mary I wyll not do so
For I can now to the merket goo
And for an haipeny as much gresse by
As shall cost me in our town a peny
And I tell the playnly with out any bost
A halpeny is as well sauid as lost
Straw for an halpeny therin is no wast
Tary with vs a while perhapps thou mast
By our acquayntaunce now here get more
Than thou gatist with thy cart this monyth before
Straw for thi councell torde a fart
Trowist I wyll gyf up my plow or cart
And folow thy folish appityte and mynde
Nay I am not yet so mad nor so blynd
For when I am at my cart of plow
I am more meryer than other of you
I wold not chaunge my lyf nor my lyffyng
For to be made a grete lorde or a kyng
There is no ioy nor pleasure in this world here
But hyll bely fyll and make good chere
Be if prynce lorde gentilman or knaue
Hit is all the ioy that here be can haue
But these couetous and ambicious wretches
They set there myndys in honoure and ryches
So much that they be neuer content
So they lyf euer in payn and torment
But a man that can this meanys fynd
To haue fode and cloth and a mery mynde
And to desyre no more than is nedefull
That is in this worlde the lyf most ioyfull
Which lyfe in this worlde no man shall acquire
Till he subdew his insaciat desyre
