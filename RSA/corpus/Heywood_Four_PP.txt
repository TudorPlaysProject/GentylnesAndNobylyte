Truely a pardoner that may be true
But a true pardoner doth nat ensew
Ryght selde is it sene or neuer.
That treuth and pardoners dwell together
For be your pardons neuer so great
Yet them to enlarge ye wyll nat let
With suche lyes that oftymes Cryste wot
Ye seme to haue that ye haue nat
Wherfore I went my selfe to the selfe thynge
In euery place and without faynynge
Had as muche pardon there assuredly
As ye can promyse me here doutefully
Howe be it I thynke ye do but scofte
But yf ye hadde all the pardon ye kepe of
And no whyt of pardon graunted
In any place where I haue haunted
Yet of my labour I nothynge repent.
God hathe respect how eche tyme is spent
And as in his knowlege all is regarded
So by his goodnes all is rewarded
By the fyrste parte of this laste tale
It semeth you come late from the ale
For reason on your syde so farre doth fayle
That ye leue sonyng and begyn to rayle
Wherin ye forget your owne parte clerely
For ye be as vntrue as I
And in one poynte ye are beyonde me
For ye may lye by aucthoryte
And all that hath wandred so farre
That no man can be theyr controller
And where ye esteme your labour so muche
I say yet agayne my pardons be suche
That yf there were a thousande soules on a hepe
I wolde brynge them all to heuen as good chepe
As ye haue brought your selfe on pylgrymage
In the leste quarter of your vyage
Which is farre a thys syde heuen by god
There your labour and pardon is od
With smale cost and without any payne
These pardons bryngeth them to heuen playne
Geue me but a peny or two pens
And as sone as the soule departeth hens
In halfe an houre or thre quarters at moste
The soule is in heuen with the holy ghost
Sende ye any soules to heuen by water
If we dyd syr what is the mater
By god I haue a drye soule shulde thyther
I praye you let our soules go to heuen togyther
So bysy you twayne be in soules helth
May nat a potycary come in by stelth
Yes that I wyll by saynt Antony
And by the leue of thys company
Proue ye false knaues bothe or we goo
In parte of your sayenges as thys lo
Thou by thy trauayle thynkest heuen to gete
And thou by pardons and relyques countest no lete
To sende thyne owne soule to heuen sure
And all other whome thou lyste to procure
If I toke an accyon then were they blanke
For lyke theues the knaues rob away my thanke
All soules in heuen hauynge relefe
Shall they thanke your craftes nay thanke myn chefe
No soule ye knowe entreth heuen gate
Tyll from the bodye he be separate
And whome haue ye knowen dye hostlye
Without helpe of the potycary
Nay all that commeth to our handlynge
Except ye happe to come to hangynge
That way perchaunce ye shall nat myster
To go to heuen without a glyster
But be ye sure I wolde be wo
If ye shulde chaunge to begyle me so
As good to lye with me a nyght
As hange abrode in the mone lyght
There is no choyse to fle my hande
But as I sayd into the bande
Syns of our soules the multitude
I sende to heuen when all is vewed
Who shulde but I then all togyther
Haue thanke of all theyr commynge thyther
If ye kylde a thousande in an houre space
When come they to heuen dyenge from state of grace
If a thousƒÅde pardons about your neckes were teyd
When come they to heuen yf they neuer dyed
Longe lyfe after good workes in dede
Doth hynder mannes receyt of mede
And deth before one dewty done
May make vs thynke we dye to sone
Yet better tary a thynge then haue it
Then go to sone and vaynly craue it
The longer ye dwell in communicacion
The lesse shall you lyke thys ymagynacyon
For ye may perceyue euen at the fyrst chop
Your tale is trapt in such a stop
That at the leste ye seme worse then we
By the masse I holde vs nought all thre
By our lady then haue I gone wronge
And yet to be here I thought longe
Brother ye haue gone wronge no wyt
I prayse your fortune and your wyt
That can dyrecte you so discretely
To plante you in this company
Thou palmer and thou a pardoner
I a potycary.
And I a pedler
Nowe on my fayth full well watched
Were the deuyll were we foure hatched
That maketh no mater syns we be matched
I coulde be mery yf that I catchyd
Some money for parte of the ware in my packe
What the deuyll hast thou there at thy backe
Why dost thou nat knowe that euery pedled
In euery tryfull must be a medler
Specyally in womens tryflynges
Those vse we chefe aboue all thynges
Which thynges to se yf ye be disposed
Beholde what ware here is disclosed
Thys gere sheweth it selfe in suche bewte
That eche man thynketh it sayth come bye me
Loke were your selfe can lyke to be chooser
Your selfe shall make pryce though I be looser
Is here nothynge for my father Palmer
Haue ye nat a want on in a corner
For your walkyng to holy places
By cryste I haue herde of as straunge cases
Who lyueth in loue or loue wolde wynne
Euen at this packe he must begynne
Where is ryght many a proper token
Of which by name parte shall be spoken
Gloues, pynnes, combes, glasses vnspottyd
Pomanders, hookes, and lasses knotted
Broches, rynges, and all maner bedes
Lace rounde and flat for womens hedes
Nedyls, threde thymbell, shers, and all suche knackes
Where louers be no suche thynges lackes
Sypers swathbondes rybandes and sleue laces
Gyrdyls, knyues, purses, and pyncases.
