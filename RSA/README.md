JPEG image files of the cluster analysis plots presented in Maura
Giles-Watson's talk "The Tudor Plays Project: New Findings on the
Disputed Authorship of Gentylnes and Nobylyte" can be found in the
_plots_ folder. The plots were generated using the Stylometry with
R package provided by the [Computational Stylistics
Group](https://sites.google.com/site/computationalstylistics/)
(Maciej Eder, Jan Rybicki, and Mike Kestemont). If you are interested
in reproducing the results, install [R](https://www.r-project.org/),
(optionally) [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and the Stylometry
with R package, then run the R script _batch.R_. Technical and other
questions welcome at pevans@sandiego.edu.
