I say the comyn well of euery land
In fete of marchauntdyse doth pryncypally stand
For if oure commoditees be vtteryd for nought
In to strange landis and no ryches brought
Hydyr therfore we shuld come to beggary

Our contrey is to colde and not hote I now
With out whych thyngis we shulde lyfe in mysery
And oft tymes for lak of them we shulde dye

And cause such thyngis to come hyder dayly
For the comfort of thys land and commen welth
And to all the people grete proffer and helth
And for such noble dedys reason wyll than

And nother of you both that here now be
