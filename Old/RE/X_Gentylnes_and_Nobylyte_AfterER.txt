Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte.
A dyaloge betwen the Marchaut the Knyght and the plowman dysputyng who is a verey Gentylman and who is a Noble man and how men shuld come to auctoryte / compilid in maner of an enterlude with divers toys and geftis addyd therto to make mery pastyme and disport.
The marchaunt
O what a gret welth and prosperyte
It is to any reme where marchauntes be
Hauing fre lyberte and entercours also
All marchaundyse to comuey to and fro
Whych thing I have vsed and the verey fet found
And thereby gotton many a thousand pownd
Wherfore now be cause of my grete ryches
Thoroughowt this land in every place doubtles
I am magnyfyed and gretly regardyd
And for a wyse and noble man estemyd
The knyght
Maister marchaunt I here you ryght well
But now in presumpsion me think ye excell
To call yourself noble in presence here
I wys men know what your auncestours were
And of what grete stock descendid ye be
Your fadyr was but a blacke smyth perde
March.
Why syr what than what be you I pray you
Knyght
Mary I am a gentylman I wold ye know
And may dispend yerely v.C. mark land
And I am sure all that ye have in hand
Of yerely rent is not worth v. markys
M
But I wold thou knewist for all thy krakkys
I am able to bye now all the land
That thou hast and pay for it out of hand
Whych I have got by myn own labour and wit
K
Yet art thou but a chorle and I have a skorn
Thou shuldist compare with me a gentylman born
M
Why what callest thou a gentylman tel me
K
Mary I call them gentylmen that be
Born to grete landys by inherytaunce
As myn auncestours by comtynuaunce
Have had this v.C. yere of whom now I
Am desendid and commyn lynyally
Beryng the same name and armys also
That they bare this v.C. yere agoo
Myn auncestours also have ever be
Lordys Knyghtes and in grete auctoryte
Capteyns in the warr and gouerners
And also in tyme of pease gret rulers
And thin were never but artysycers
As smythis masonis carpentars or weuars
M
All that is trewth I wyl not denye now
Yet I am more gentylman born than thou
For I call hym a gentylman that gentilly
Doth gyf unto other men louyngly
Such thing as he hath of hys own pper
But he that takith ought away from a nother
And doth gyf hym no thing agayn therfore
Owght to be callyd a chorle evermore
But myn auncestours have giffyn alwey
To thin auncestours such thing as they
By their labours did trewly get and wyn
For myn auncestours bildid howsis wherein
Thyne auncestours have had their dwellyng place
Also myn auncestours have made tolis
To all maner crafti men belongyng
Wherby clothis and every other thing
Where of thin auncestours nede have had
With the same tolys have ever be made
So myn auncestours have gyffin their labours
ever to comfort and help thin auncestours
K
I deny that ever thauncestours of thyne
Did ever gif to the auncestours of myne
At any tyme any thing except that they
Gafe some what therfor other ware or money
M
Mary god a mercy Iohn for that now
That is euyn a pyg of our own sow
How can lordys and estatis have ought in store
Except thartyfycers do get it before
For all metalis be dyggyd furst by myners
And after wrought by the artyfycers
woll fell and every other thing
That is necessary to mannys coueryng
And all other thingis that men vse and were
Is al wey made by the artyfycer
K
I graunt that the artyfycers do make it
But be cause comenly they have lytell wyt
Gentylmen that have landys and domynyon
Of all such ryches have most possessyon
For reason wyll ever it shuld so be
wyse men to have folys in captyuyte
M
Mary as for wyt and subtell inuencyou
Myne auncestours wyth thine may make comperison
For though my fader were a smyth what than
yet was he a meruelous quyk wyttyd man
And coud work as well for hys pert
As any in this land vsyng that art
And deuyse new fassyons in chinges that he made
That every man to bye hys ware was glad
And carue and grave in yron and stele
Both Image and letters meruelously wele
And ther on ley gold and gylt it also
Fyne and pure as any gold smyth coud do
My grauntfader also was a mason
Of grete wyt as any in thys regyon
And coud byld a castell and tour ryght well
In whych some of thy kynnys men now do dwell
where in aperyth ryght good masonry
wyth Immagys and armys wrought curyously
My grete graundfadyr lo was a wever
Of wollyn yarn and of other gere
And made meruelous pleasaunt workis to be hold
Lynyn dyaper sylk and cloth of gold
All such subtell thingis as I have rehersyd lo
Myne auncestours by theyr wyttis coud work and do
And as for thyne auncestours I know no thing
Thei coud do bi their wittis worth of praisyng
But vse occupi and wast ever more
Such thingis as myn auncestours  before
And thou and thie auncestours  
Of such thingis wrought  
Of other men oughtist not be praysed therfore
But the prayse ought to be gyuen ever more
To the artyfycer whych by hys wyt
It deuysyd and so comnyngly wrought it
wherefore yf thou sey that wyt and polesy
Be the thingis perteynyng to gentry
Thin auncestours may never compare wyth, mine
For theyr actis proue them wyser than thyne
For thin dyd never no thing in theyr days
Concernyng quyk wyt that was worthy prays
K
yes I wis lewd Iavell I wold thou knewist it
Myn auncestours have had more wysedome and wyt
Than thyne have had and coud do also
Many thinges that thyne coud never do
for in the contrey at sessyons and syse
They have be electe to be Iustyce
And for theyer wyt and grete dyscressyon
They have Iuggyd and donne correccyon
Uppon thyne auncestours artyfycers
That have made false warys and ben dysseyuers
And holpe for to maynteyn every thinge
That ys to the comyn weith pteynyng
They have ben also in tyme of warr
Both in thys land and other courreys farr
Dukrs and leders of the hole army
And by theire wyttis and warly polycy
Study forecast and dilygent trauayle
Have won many a grete fyld and batayle
And thyne auncestours that were there
were never able to bere shyld nor spere
And were never but soldyars and pyoners
Nor never had wysdome to be rulers
But because myn auncestours have ever be
Dyscrete and wyse they have had anctoryte
M
Nay nay thyne auncestours cam never all
To auctoryte for wysdome p̄ncypall
For though some were wise yet some of them agayn
Had small discression lytyll wyt or brayn
But because of the long comtynuannce
Of theyr grete possessions by enherytaunce
By the folysh maner of the worlde we see
For that cause ever they have had auctorite
K
And I say that good reason agreth to it
For though the fader have no grete wyt
The sone that is wyse shuld never the more
Lose hys land or auctoryte therfore
For he that by study dylygens and payn
Grete landys or possessyons doth attayn
Hys owne lyfe is to shorte and to lyte
For to take the frute of his meryte
Reason wolde therfore that after hys lyfe
Hys heyrs before straungers have p̄rogatyfe
And the comtynuaunce of such possessyons
Makyth noble men and gentyll condycyons
And they whos blode hath long contynued
As gentylmen so they shuld be honoured
And so myn auncestours long tyme have be
Grete possyssyoners and in auctoryte
Therefore consyderyng my grete lynage
My blode my noble byrth and parentage
Thou art not able to compare wt me
Nother in gentylnes nor in nobylyte
Here the plouman commith in with a short whyp in hys hand and spekyth as folowith
Plow.
Nowhere is bybbyll babbyll clytter clatter
I hard never of so folysh a matter
But by goddys body to speke the troth
I am better than other of you bothe
K
Auaunt kanker de chorle fro whens commyst thou
P
Mary folysh peuysh daw even fro my plow
Now sayst woldyst any thing there wtall
M
ye mary thou lewyd vyllayn and rud raskall
It is for the full yll besemyng
To perturb any gentylmens talkyng
P
Gentylmen ye gentylmen Iak heryng
Put your shone in your bosome for weryng
I accompt myself by goddys body
Better than you bothe and more worthy
K
Auaunt knave get the out of the gate
Or I shall lay my sworde on thy pate
P
That shall I proue I make god auow
Never in better tyme have at the now
Et verberat eos
M
Now holde thy hand felow I the pray
And harkyn what I shall to the say
P
Sey knave say what canst sey
M
Holde thy hand I pray the and com no narr
I am a marchaunt and no man of warr

K
Thou art not honest I tell the playnly
To make any quarrel here so sodaynly
To perturb our communycacyon
P
Here ye may se syrs by goddys passyon
Two proude folys make a crakkyng
And when it commyth to poynt dare do no thing
M
Our commyng hyder and our entent
ys not to fyght but by way of argument
every man to shew hys oppinyon
To see who coude shew the best reason
To proue hym self noble and most gentylman
P
By god all the reasons syth ye began
That ye have made therof be not worth a fly
K
No syr I pray the than tell me why
P
Furst as touching noblenes I say
Ther is nother of you both dyd {pro}ue or lay
Ony of your actys wherby that ye
Shulde in reason {pro}ue you noble to be
Or therby deserue any maner praysyng
But all the effect of your arguyng
To proue your noblenes was but only
Of the deddys and actis of your auncestry
And of the actis that your auncestours did before
ye at the nobler never the more
K
As touching my self I dare make compison
Of as noble dedys as he hath any done
For I am and have ben one of the cheualry
At the commaundement of my prynce everredy
And every tyme of warr have be captayn
And leder of a .M. men or twayne
And wt hors and harnes spere and sheld
Have Ioydyd my body in every felde
The rentis of my landys have spende lyberally
And kept a grete house contynually
And holp to ponyssh theuys and brybers alwey
To the grete tranqaylyte of my contray
And you maister merchaumt wyt never take labour
Except it be for your {pro}ffet and lucoure
Plow.
Go to go to now master marchaunt
There is a reason that gyuyth you a taunt
I trow more than you can answere well
M
Nay I wys pyvysh and rude Iak Iavell
I can make an answere so substancyally
wher to nother of you is able to reply

K
If thou canst answere my reason do
M
That can I well doo. P. Then go to fole go to
M
I say the comyn well of every land
In fete of marchauntdyse doth pryncypally stand
For if oure commoditees be vtteryd for nought
In to strange landis and no ryches brought
Hydyr therfore / we shuld come to beggary
And all men dryffyn to lyf in mysery
Them we noble marchauntis that in this reame be
what a grete welth to thys land do we
we vtter our warys and by theyrs good chepe
And bryng them hyder that grete {pro}ffet
And pleasure dayly commyth to this regyon
Too all maner people that here do won
Forthermore ye see well wt youre eyes
That of straynge landis the commodytees
we have such nede of them that be there
That in no wyse we may them for bere
As oyle sylkis frutis and spyces also
Golde syluer yryn and other metall is moo
All drammys and druggys longyng to physyke
whych men must nedes have when they be seke
whych in thys reame can not well grow
Our comtrey is to colde and not hote I now
wt out whych thingis we shulde lyfe in mysery
And oft tymes for lak of them we shulde dye
And I spende my studi and labour contynually
And cause such thingis to come hyder dayly
For the comfort of thys land and commen welth
And to all the people grete, pffer and helth
And for such noble dedys reason wyll than
That I ought to be callyd a noble man
And nother of you both that here now be
In noblenes may accompare wt me
P
Now well hit by goddes body well hit
Of one that hath but lyttyll wyt
Answere me one worde furst I pray the
what is the noblest thinge that can be
K
what saist thou therto thi self let see
P
Is not yt the noblest thing in dede
That of all other thingis hath lest nede
As god which beynith etern in blysse
Is not he the noblest thing yt is
K
yes mary no man in reason can that deny

P
well than there is no reason therof why
But because he is the thing omnipotent
And is in hun self so suffycyent
And nedyth the helpe of no nothyr thing
To the helpe of hys gloryous beyng
But every other thing hath nede of his ayde
M
Mary that is very trough and well sayde
P
And lykwyse yt thinge that hath most nede
Is the thing that is most wreched
So suffycyency is ever noblenes
And necessyte is ever wrechydnes
And he that hath more nede of that thing
For the p̄teruacyon of hys lyuyng
Then his felow hath his felow must nedis be
By thys same reason more noble than he
what than .P. by the same reason it {pro}uith lo
ye be but caytyffis and wrechis both two
And by the same reason {pro}ue I shall
That I am the noblest man of vs all
For I have nede of no maner thing
That ye can do to help of my lyffyng
For every thing whereby ye do lyf
I noryss it and to you both do gyf
I plow I tyll and I ster the ground
wherby I make the corn to habounde
whereof ther is made both drynk and bred
wych the which dayly ye must nedis be fed
I noryss the catell and fowlys also
Fyssh and herbis and other thingie mo
Fell herr and woll whych the bestis do bere
I noryssh and preserue which ye do were
which yf ye had not no dowt ye shuld
Starue for sak of clothis because of colde
So both you shulde die or lyue in necessite
If ye had not comfort and help of me
And as for your fyne cloth and costly aray
I cannot see whi ye ought or mai
Call your self noble because ye were it
which was made bi other menis labour and wit
And also your dilicate drinkis and viand
Bi other menis labours be made so pleasand
Therefore mayster marchaunt now to you I sei
I can not see but I am able and mai
Lyf wythout you or your purueaunce
Lyue wythout you or your purueyaunce
For of fode and cloth I have suffisaunce
Of my self for lyffing necessary
And now sir knyght to you I sey playnly
I see not that ye can any thing do
For the commyn well or ought longyng therto
But ech man beyng in auctoryte
Hauyng wit may do it as well as ye
Therfore to spek now of necessyte
Ther is nother of you both but ye be
In more nede than I therfore I sey playn
I am more noble than other of you twayn
Now that is a folysh reason so god me save
For by the same reason thou woldyst have
everi best fyssh and other foule than
To be more noble of birth than a man
For man hath more nede of bodely coueryng
Than they have for they nede no thinge
The bestis have herr and also a thik skin
The fissh skalis or shelis to kepe theyr bodyes in
The foulis fethirs and so everi thing
Bi nature hath his {pro}per couering
Save man himself which is born all nakyd
And therfore he shuld be than most wrechyd
P
Mary no man can make a better reason
For that is a sure and a trew comclusyon
For if a child when he is furst born
were not holp and coueryd he were sone lorn
He hath no strenght to help hym never a dell
yet bestis have power to help them self well
So comsideryng mamns body in dede
A best is more noble and man more wrechyd
Be cause he hath nede of many mo thingis
Than bestis have to help of theyer lyffyngis
Also man must dayly labour and swete
To get hym sustynaunce as drynk and mete
The grownd he must dyg and the bestis kyll
For brede and mete his bodi to fyll
Grapis frutis and herbis norssh dyligently
To make good drynkis to refressh his body
But all brut bestis have coueryng natural
Sufficyent to couer their bodyes with all
And fynd theyr fode ever on the grownd redy
with out any payn labour or study
So everi man by reason of hys body
Is more wrechyd and in more mysery
Than bestis be / yet thus not wythstandyng
Man is most noble of creaturis lyuyng
Not by hys body for that is impotent
But by hys soule beyng so excellent
For by reason of hys soule intyllectyue
He subde wyth all other bestis alyue
And compellyth all other bestis that be
By hys wit to releve his necessyte
But bestis have no wyt them self to defende
Nor can get no more than god hath them send
For take any best that weryth heer
And do clyp it of bare a gayns wynter
That best hath no maner of polecy
To get other coueryng for hys body
Of cloth nor skyns nor hath no wyt
To put it vppon hym though one have made it
Nor can byld no house nor kyndyl no fyre
To warme hys body yf nede shuld requyre
But yet a man hath wyt and vnderstandyng
For to help hym self in every such thing
So man for his soule intellectuall
Is most noble creature of bestis all
M
That is a verey good and preguant reason
yet me thinkith thou makist a degression
From the argument that we furst began
which was to {pro}ue who was most gentylman
whych we disputyd I wold thou haddist hard it
P
Tussh I hard what ye seyd everi whit
K
Then shew thy reason therin or thou go
P
Nay be god I have some what ells to do
I must go by me a halporth of gresse
The spokes of my cart therwith to dresse
Trow ye that I wyll leve my bysynes
For your babelyng pomp and folysshnes
Nay by sent mary I wyll not do so
For I can now to the merket goo
And for an haipeny as much gresse by
As shall cost me in our town a peny
And I tell the playnly wt out any bost
A halpeny is as well sauid as lost
P
Straw for an halpeny therin is no wast
Tary with vs a while phapps thou mast
By our acquayntaunce now here get more
Than thou gatist with thy cart this monyth before
P
Straw for thi councell torde a fart
Trowist I wyll gyf up my plow or cart
And folow thy folish appityte and mynde
Nay I am not yet so mad nor so blynd
For when I am at my cart of plow
I am more meryer than other of you
I wold not chaunge my lyf nor my lyffyng
For to be made a grete lorde or a kyng
There is no ioy nor pleasure in this world here
But hyll bely fyll and make good chere
Be if prynce lorde gentilman or knave
Hit is all the ioy that here be can have
But these couetous and ambicious wretches
They set there myndys in honoure and ryches
So much that they be never content
So they lyf ever in payn and torment
But a man that can this meanys fynd
To have fode and cloth and a mery mynde
And to desyre no more than is nedefull
That is in this worlde the lyf most ioyfull
Which lyfe in this worlde no man shall acquire
Till he subdew his insaciat desyre
M
I see well thou has a curst apysh wit
Then yf thou wylt depart I pray the yet
Come agayn when thy bisines is doo
P
For what intent now shuld I do so
M
For we will in owre olde argument prosede
Who shulde be callyd a gentylman in dede
And we wolde be glade to here thy reason
P
I wyll come agayn uppon a condicion
That ye wyll wayt uppon me both twayn
And be not out of the way when I come agayn
K
We wyll not be farr hens P. then I wil not fayle
M
Then I pray the let not the pmise quaile
P
Lo here is my fynger now trust me well
I will come agayn yf I have my hele
For by god I promyse you one thing
I am as trew of my worde as the Kyng
But if I fynde you not here then by my trough
I shall call you oppenly false knauys both
M
Thou shalt fynde us trew in every thing
P
I think so / except lyeng and stelyng

K
Then far well for a season a dew
Then fare ye well both I dare say as trew
As some that be tyede in newgate
M
well now he is gone god speed well his gate
But what shall we do now the meane season
K
Let us take now some recreacyon
And come agayn here and keep our poyntment
M
Now therto I am ryght well content
And in the meayn wyle good lord of thy grace
Preserue all the people here in this place
Amen
