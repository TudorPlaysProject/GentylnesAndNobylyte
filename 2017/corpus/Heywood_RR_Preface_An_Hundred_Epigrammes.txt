¶ To the reader.



RYme without reason, and reason without ryme
In this conuercion depe diffrence dooeth fall.
In first parte wherof where I am falne this tyme,
The foly I graunt, whiche graunted (readers all)
Your graunt, to grannt this request require I shall,
Ere ye full reiecte these trifl•s folowyng here
Perceiue (I praie you) of the woordes thententes clere.

¶ In whiche (maie ye lyke to looke) ye shall es•ie
Some woordes, shewe one sense, another to disclose,
Some woordes them selues sondrie senses signifie:
Some woordes, somwhat from common sence, I dispose,
To seeme one sense in text, another in glose.
These words in this work, thus wrought your workyng toole,
Maie woorke me to seeme (at least) the les a foole.

¶ Than in rough rude termes of homely honestee,
(For vnhonest terme (I truste) there non• here soundes)
Wherin fine tender eares shall offended bee,
Those folies, beyng sercht in reasons boundes,
Reason maie bee surgin in saluyng those woundes,
••••yng those sores to salues: for reason dooeth gesse,
Homly matters, homly termes dooe best expresse.

¶ But where all defence standth in exempcion
To defend me her in out of folies bandes,
So that to redeeme me thers no redempcion.
•rauntyng and submittyng foly, that so standes,
This last refuge I craue to haue, at your handes,
Those folies ••an•yng clere from intent of yll.
In lieu or lacke of good wit, accept good wyll,   [end]
