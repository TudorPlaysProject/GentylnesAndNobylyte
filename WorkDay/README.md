I've found four copies of the file X_Gentylnes_and_Nobylyte.txt in
the GitHub repository, representing three distinct versions.

The oldest version is represented by the files:
./GentylnesAndNobylyte/Old/RE/X_Gentylnes_and_Nobylyte.txt
./GentylnesAndNobylyte/RSA/corpus/X_Gentylnes_and_Nobylyte.txt
This is the version that Maura used as the basis for her Renaissance
Society of America presentation in March 2016. It has a word count
of 1591 (Unix command wc -w) and a checksum of 19233 8 (Unix command
sum).

The intermediate version is represented by the file:
./GentylnesAndNobylyte/Working/corpus/X_Gentylnes_and_Nobylyte.txt
This version has a complicated history: I asked Maura to generate
3000-word samples, and then I scrubbed what she gave me in various
ways to make it suitable for analysis using stylo. It has a word
count of 3871 and a checksum of 54556 20. Use this version as the
input for your conversion program.  The most recent version is
represented by the file:
./GentylnesAndNobylyte/Working/X_Gentylnes_and_Nobylyte.txt
This is the May 2018 Victoria Maretti version. It has a word count
of 3731 and a checksum of 30048 19. Compare this version with the
output of your conversion program.

Instance of .M. found on line 265, and .P. on line 353. These will be maintained as they are abbreviations of the character being referenced.

Decision to change all bi's to by's by majority rule, however regex used to implement change is not working.
Decision to maintain spelling of "haue" and "euer(y)" in input, spellings are already standardized.
