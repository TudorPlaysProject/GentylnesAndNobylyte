
Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte.
A dyaloge betwen the Marchaut the Knyght and the plowman dysputyng who is a verey Gentylman and who is a Noble man and how men shuld come to auctoryte / compilid in maner of an enterlude with divers toys and geftis addyd therto to make mery pastyme and disport.
The marchaunt
O what a gret welth and prosperyte
It is to any reme where marchauntes be
Hauing fre lyberte and entercours also
All marchaundyse to convey to and fro
Whych thyng I haue vsed and the verey fet found
And thereby gotton many a thousand pownd
Wherfore now be cause of my grete ryches
Thoroughowt this land in euery place doubtles
I am magnyfyed and gretly regardyd
And for a wyse and noble man estemyd
The knyght
Maister marchaunt I here you ryght well
But now in presumpsion me thynk ye excell
To call yourself noble in presence here
I wys men know what your auncestours were
And of what grete stock descendid ye be
Your fadyr was but a blacke smyth perde
March.
Why syr what than what be you I pray you
Knyght
Mary I am a gentylman I wold ye know
And may dispend yerely v.C. mark land
And I am sure all that ye haue in hand
Of yerely rent is not worth v. markys

But I wold thou knewist for all thy krakkys
I am able to bye now all the land
That thou hast and pay for it out of hand
Whych I haue got by myn own labour and wit

Yet art thou but a chorle and I haue a skorn
Thou shuldist cōpare with me a gentylman born

Why what callyst thou a gentylman tel me

Mary I call them gentylmen that be
Born to grete landys by inherytaunce
As myn auncestours by contynuaunce
Haue had this v.C. yere of whom now I
Am desendid and commyn lynyally
Beryng the same name and armys also
That they bare this v.C. yere agoo
Myn auncestours also haue euer be
Lordys Knyghtes and in grete auctoryte
Capteyns in the warr and gouerners
And also in tyme of pease gret rulers
And thyn were neuer but artysycers
As smyth{is} mason{is} carpentars or weuars

All that is trewth I wyl not denye now
Yet I am more gentylman born than thou
For I call hym a gentylman that gentilly
Doth gyf unto other men louyngly
Such thing as he hath of hys own pper
But he that takith ought away from a nother
And doth gyf hym no thyng agayn therfore
Owght to be callyd a chorle euermore
But myn auncestours haue giffyn alwey
To thyn auncestours such thyng as they
By their labours did trewly get and wyn
For myn auncestours bildid howsis wherein
Thyne auncestours haue had their dwellyng place
Also myn auncestours haue made tolis
To all maner crafti men belongyng
Wherby clothis and euery other thyng
Where of thyn auncestours nede haue had
With the same tolys haue euer be made
So myn auncestours haue gyffin their labours
Euer to cōfort and help thyn auncestours

I deny that euer thauncestours of thyne
Did euer gif to the auncestours of myne
At any tyme any thyng except that they
Gafe some what therfor other ware or money

Mary god a mercy Iohn for that now
That is euyn a pyg of our own sow
Page  [unnumbered]How can lordys and estatis haue ought in store
Except thartyfycers do get it before
For all metalis be dyggyd furst by myners
And after wrought by the artyfycers
woll fell and euery other thyng
That is necessary to mannys coueryng
And all other thyngis that men vse and were
Is al wey made by the artyfycer

I graunt that the artyfycers do make it
But be cause comenly they haue lytell wyt
Gentylmen that haue landys and domynyon
Of all such ryches haue most possessyon
For reason wyll euer it shuld so be
wyse men to haue folys in captyuyte

Mary as for wyt and subtell inuencyou
Myne auncestours wyth thine may make cooperison
For though my fader were a smyth what than
yet was he a meruelous quyk wyttyd man
And coud work as well for hys {per}t
As any in this land vsyng that art
And deuyse new fassyons in chynges that he made
That euery man to bye hys ware was glad
And carue & graue in yron & stele
Both Image & letters meruelously wele
And ther on ley gold & gylt it also
Fyne & pure as any gold smyth coud do
My grauntfader also was a mason
Of grete wyt as any in thys regyon
And coud byld a castell & tour ryght well
In whych some of thy kynnys men now do dwell
where in aperyth ryght good masonry
wyth Immagys & armys wrought curyously
My grete graundfadyr lo was a weuer
Of wollyn yarn & of other gere
And made meruelous pleasaunt workis to be hold
Lynyn dya{per} sylk & cloth of gold
All such subtell thyngis as I haue rehersyd lo
Myne auncestours by theyr wyttis coud work & do
And as for thyne auncestours I know no thyng
Thei coud do bi their wittis worth of praisyng
But vse occupi & wast euer more
Such thyngis as myn auncestours 〈◊〉 before
And thou & thie auncestours 〈◊◊◊〉 
Of such thingis wrought 〈◊◊◊〉 
Page  [unnumbered]Of other men oughtist not be praysed therfore
But the prayse ought to be gyuen euer more
To the artyfycer whych by hys wyt
It deuysyd and so cōnyngly wrought it
wherefore yf thou sey that wyt & polesy
Be the thyng{is} perteynyng to gentry
Thyn auncestours may neuer cōpare wyth, mine
For theyr act{is} proue them wyser than thyne
For thyn dyd neuer no thyng in theyr days
Concernyng quyk wyt that was worthy prays
K
yes I wis lewd Iauell I wold thou knewist it
Myn auncestours haue had more wysedome & wyt
Than thyne haue had & coud do also
Many thynges that thyne coud neuer do
for in the contrey at sessyons and syse
They haue be electe to be Iustyce
And for theyer wyt and grete dyscressyon
They haue Iuggyd and donne correccyon
Uppon thyne auncestours artyfycers
That haue made false warys & ben dysseyuers
And holpe for to maynteyn euery thynge
That ys to the comyn weith pteynyng
They haue ben also in tyme of warr
Both in thys land & other courreys farr
Dukrs & leders of the hole army
And by theire wyttis & warly polycy
Study forecast & dilygent trauayle
Haue won many a grete fyld & batayle
And thyne auncestours that were there
were neuer able to bere shyld nor spere
And were neuer but soldyars & pyoners
Nor neuer had wysdome to be rulers
But because myn auncestours haue euer be
Dyscrete & wyse they haue had anctoryte
M
Nay nay thyne auncestours cam neuer all
To auctoryte for wysdome p̄ncypall
For though sōe were wise yet some of thē agayn
Had small discression lytyll wyt or brayn
But because of the long cōtynuannce
Of theyr grete possessions by enherytaunce
By the folysh maner of the worlde we see
For that cause euer they haue had auctorite
K
And I say that good reason agreth to it
For though the fader haue no grete wyt
Page  [unnumbered]The sone that is wyse shuld neuer the more
Lose hys land or auctoryte therfore
For he that by study dylygens & payn
Grete landys or possessyons doth attayn
Hys owne lyfe is to shorte & to lyte
For to take the frute of his meryte
Reason wolde therfore that after hys lyfe
Hys heyrs before straungers haue p̄rogatyfe
And the cōtynuaunce of such possessyons
Makyth noble men & gentyll condycyons
And they whos blode hath long contynued
As gentylmen so they shuld be honoured
And so myn auncestours long tyme haue be
Grete possyssyoners and in auctoryte
Therefore consyderyng my grete lynage
My blode my noble byrth and parentage
Thou art not able to compare wt me
Nother in gentylnes nor in nobylyte
¶Here the plouman cōmith in with a short whyp in hys hand & spekyth as folowith
Plow.
¶Nowhere is bybbyll babbyll clytter clatter
I hard neuer of so folysh a matter
But by goddys body to speke the troth
I am better than other of you bothe
K
Auaunt kanker de chorle fro whens cōmyst thou
P
Mary folysh peuysh daw euen fro my plow
Now sayst woldyst any thyng there wtall
M
ye mary thou lewyd vyllayn & rud raskall
It is for the full yll besemyng
To {per}turb any gentylmens talkyng
P
¶Gentylmen ye gentylmen Iak heryng
Put your shone in your bosome for weryng
I accompt myself by goddys body
Better than you bothe and more worthy
K
Auaunt knaue get the out of the gate
Or I shall lay my sworde on thy pate
P
That shall I proue I make god auow
Neuer in better tyme haue at the now
Et verberat eos
M
Now holde thy hand felow I the pray
And harkyn what I shall to the say
P
Sey knaue say what canst sey
M
Holde thy hand I pray the & com no narr
I am a marchaunt & no man of warr
Page  [unnumbered]
K
Thou art not honest I tell the playnly
To make any quarrel here so sodaynly
To {per}turb our cōmunycacyon
P
Here ye may se syrs by goddys passyon
Two proude folys make a crakkyng
And when it cōmyth to poynt dare do no thyng
M
Our cōmyng hyder & our entent
ys not to fyght but by way of argument
Euery man to shew hys oppinyon
To see who coude shew the best reason
To proue hym self noble & most gentylman
P
By god all the reasons syth ye began
That ye haue made therof be not worth a fly
K
¶No syr I pray the than tell me why
P
¶Furst as touchyng noblenes I say
Ther is nother of you both dyd {pro}ue or lay
Ony of your actys wherby that ye
Shulde in reason {pro}ue you noble to be
Or therby deserue any maner praysyng
But all the effect of your arguyng
To proue your noblenes was but only
Of the deddys & act{is} of your auncestry
And of the act{is} that your auncestours did before
ye at the nobler neuer the more
K
¶As touchyng my self I dare make compison
Of as noble dedys as he hath any done
For I am & haue ben one of the cheualry
At the cōmaundement of my prynce euerredy
And euery tyme of warr haue be captayn
And leder of a .M. men or twayne
And wt hors & harnes spere and sheld
Haue Ioydyd my body in euery felde
The rent{is} of my landys haue spende lyberally
And kept a grete house contynually
And holp to ponyssh theuys & brybers alwey
To the grete tranqaylyte of my contray
And you maister merchaūt wyt neuer take labour
Except it be for your {pro}ffet and lucoure
Plow.
Go to go to now master marchaunt
There is a reason that gyuyth you a taunt
I trow more than you can answere well
M
¶Nay I wys pyvysh & rude Iak Iauell
I can make an answere so substancyally
wher to nother of you is able to reply
Page  [unnumbered]
K
If thou canst answere my reason do
M
That can I well doo. P. Then go to fole go to
M
I say the comyn well of euery land
In fete of marchauntdyse doth pryncypally stand
For if oure cōmoditees be vtteryd for nought
In to strange landis and no ryches brought
Hydyr therfore / we shuld come to beggary
And all men dryffyn to lyf in mysery
Thē we noble marchauntis that in this reame be
what a grete welth to thys land do we
we vtter our warys & by theyrs good chepe
And bryng them hyder that grete {pro}ffet
And pleasure dayly cōmyth to this regyon
Too all maner people that here do won
Forthermore ye see well wt youre eyes
That of straynge landis the cōmodytees
we haue such nede of them that be there
That in no wyse we may them for bere
As oyle sylkis frutis & spyces also
Golde syluer yryn & other metall is moo
All drāmys & druggys longyng to physyke
whych men must nedes haue when they be seke
whych in thys reame can not well grow
Our cōtrey is to colde & not hote I now
wt out whych thyngis we shulde lyfe in mysery
And oft tymes for lak of them we shulde dye
And I spende my studi & labour contynually
And cause such thyngis to come hyder dayly
For the comfort of thys land & cōmen welth
And to all the people grete, pffer & helth
And for such noble dedys reason wyll than
That I ought to be callyd a noble man
And nother of you both that here now be
In noblenes may accompare wt me
P
Now well hit by goddes body well hit
Of one that hath but lyttyll wyt
Answere me one worde furst I pray the
what is the noblest thynge that can be
K
what saist thou therto thi self let see
P
Is not yt the noblyst thyng in dede
That of all other thyngis hath lest nede
As god which beynith etern in blysse
Is not he the noblest thyng yt is
K
yes mary no man in reason can that deny
Page  [unnumbered]
P
¶well than there is no reason therof why
But because he is the thyng omnipotent
And is in hun self so suffycyent
And nedyth the helpe of no nothyr thyng
To the helpe of hys gloryous beyng
But euery other thyng hath nede of his ayde
M
¶Mary that is very trough & well sayde
P
And lykwyse yt thynge that hath most nede
Is the thyng that is most wreched
So suffycyency is euer noblenes
And necessyte is euer wrechydnes
And he that hath more nede of that thyng
For the p̄teruacyon of hys lyuyng
Then his felow hath his felow must ned{is} be
By thys same reason more noble than he
what than .P. by the same reason it {pro}uith lo
ye be but caytyff{is} & wrechis both two
And by the same reason {pro}ue I shall
That I am the noblyst man of vs all
For I haue nede of no maner thyng
That ye can do to help of my lyffyng
For euery thyng whereby ye do lyf
I noryss it & to you both do gyf
I plow I tyll & I ster the ground
wherby I make the corn to habounde
whereof ther is made both drynk & bred
wych the which dayly ye must nedis be fed
I noryss the catell & fowlys also
Fyssh & herbis & other thyngie mo
Fell herr & woll whych the bestis do bere
I noryssh & preserue which ye do were
which yf ye had not no dowt ye shuld
Starue for sak of clothis because of colde
So both you shulde die or lyue in necessite
If ye had not cōfort & help of me
And as for your fyne cloth & costly aray
I cannot see whi ye ought or mai
Call your self noble because ye were it
which was made bi other menis labour & wit
And also your dilicate drinkis & viand
Bi other menis labours be made so pleasand
Therefore mayster marchaunt now to you I sei
I can not see but I am able & mai
Lyf wythout you or your purueaunce
Page  [unnumbered]Lyue wythout you or your purueyaunce
For of fode & cloth I haue suffisaunce
Of my self for lyffing necessary
And now sir knyght to you I sey playnly
I see not that ye can any thyng do
For the cōmyn well or ought longyng therto
But ech man beyng in auctoryte
Hauyng wit may do it as well as ye
Therfore to spek now of necessyte
Ther is nother of you both but ye be
In more nede than I therfore I sey playn
I am more noble than other of you twayn
Now that is a folysh reason so god me saue
For by the same reason thou woldyst haue
Eueri best fyssh & other foule than
To be more noble of birth than a man
For man hath more nede of bodely coueryng
Than they haue for they nede no thinge
The best{is} haue herr & also a thik skin
The fissh skalis or shelis to kepe theyr bodyes in
The foulis fethirs & so eueri thing
Bi nature hath his {pro}per couering
Saue man himself which is born all nakyd
And therfore he shuld be than most wrechyd
P
¶Mary no man can make a better reason
For that is a sure & a trew cōclusyon
For if a child when he is furst born
were not holp & coueryd he were sone lorn
He hath no strenght to help hym neuer a dell
yet bestis haue power to help them self well
¶So cōsideryng māns body in dede
A best is more noble & man more wrechyd
Be cause he hath nede of many mo thyngis
Than bestis haue to help of theyer lyffyngis
Also man must dayly labour & swete
To get hym sustynaunce as drynk & mete
The grownd he must dyg & the bestis kyll
For brede and mete his bodi to fyll
Grapis frutis and herbis norssh dyligently
To make good drynkis to refressh his body
But all brut bestis haue coueryng natural
Sufficyent to couer their bodyes with all
And fynd theyr fode euer on the grownd redy
with out any payn labour or study
Page  [unnumbered]So eueri man by reason of hys body
Is more wrechyd & in more mysery
Than best{is} be / yet thus not wythstandyng
Man is most noble of creatur{is} lyuyng
Not by hys body for that is impotent
But by hys soule beyng so excellent
For by reason of hys soule intyllectyue
He subde wyth all other best{is} alyue
And cōpellyth all other bestis that be
By hys wit to releue his necessyte
But bestis haue no wyt them self to defende
Nor can get no more than god hath them send
For take any best that weryth heer
And do clyp it of bare a gayns wynter
That best hath no maner of polecy
To get other coueryng for hys body
Of cloth nor skyns nor hath no wyt
To put it vppon hym though one haue made it
Nor can byld no house nor kyndyl no fyre
To warme hys body yf nede shuld requyre
But yet a man hath wyt & vnderstandyng
For to help hym self in euery such thyng
So man for his soule intellectuall
Is most noble creature of bestis all
M
¶That is a verey good & preguant reason
yet me thynkith thou makist a degression
From the argument that we furst began
which was to {pro}ue who was most gentylman
whych we disputyd I wold thou haddist hard it
P
¶Tussh I hard what ye seyd everi whit
K
¶Then shew thy reason therin or thou go
P
¶Nay be god I haue some what ells to do
I must go by me a halporth of gresse
The spokes of my cart therwith to dresse
Trow ye that I wyll leue my bysynes
For your babelyng pomp & folysshnes
Nay by sent mary I wyll not do so
For I can now to the merket goo
And for an haipeny as much gresse by
As shall cost me in our town a peny
And I tell the playnly wt out any bost
A halpeny is as well sauid as lost
P
¶Straw for an halpeny therin is no wast
Tary with vs a while phapps thou mast
Page  [unnumbered]By our acquayntaunce now here get more
Than thou gatist with thy cart this monyth before
P
¶Straw for thi councell torde a fart
Trowist I wyll gyf up my plow or cart
And folow thy folish appityte and mynde
Nay I am not yet so mad nor so blynd
For when I am at my cart of plow
I am more meryer than other of you
I wold not chaunge my lyf nor my lyffyng
For to be made a grete lorde or a kyng
There is no ioy nor pleasure in this world here
But hyll bely fyll and make good chere
Be if prynce lorde gentilman or knaue
Hit is all the ioy that here be can haue
But these couetous and ambicious wretches
They set there myndys in honoure and ryches
So much that they be neuer content
So they lyf euer in payn and torment
But a man that can this meanys fynd
To haue fode and cloth and a mery mynde
And to desyre no more than is nedefull
That is in this worlde the lyf most ioyfull
Which lyfe in this worlde no man shall acquire
Till he subdew his insaciat desyre
M
¶I see well thou has a curst apysh wit
Then yf thou wylt depart I pray the yet
Come agayn when thy bisines is doo
P
¶For what intent now shuld I do so
M
¶For we will in owre olde argument prosede
Who shulde be callyd a gentylman in dede
And we wolde be glade to here thy reason
P
¶I wyll come agayn uppon a condicion
That ye wyll wayt uppon me both twayn
And be not out of the way when I come agayn
K
¶We wyll not be farr hens P. then I wil not fayle
M
¶Then I pray the let not the pmise quaile
P
¶Lo here is my fynger now trust me well
I will come agayn yf I haue my hele
For by god I promyse you one thyng
I am as trew of my worde as the Kyng
But if I fynde you not here then by my trough
I shall call you oppenly false knauys both
M
¶Thou shalt fynde us trew in euery thyng
P
¶I thynk so / except lyeng and stelyng
Page  [unnumbered]
K
Then far well for a season a dew
Then fare ye well both I dare say as trew
As some that be tyede in newgate
M
well now he is gone god speed well his gate
But what shall we do now the meane season
K
Let us take now some recreacyon
And come agayn here and keep our poyntment
M
Now therto I am ryght well content
And in the meayn wyle good lord of thy grace
Preserue all the people here in this place
Amen
